Some project ideas I would like to do in my spare time

## Quizzer ([first approach here](https://question-master.herokuapp.com/))
An application which quizzes you exam questions and shows the answers after a test. The optimal workflow would be

1. As you prepare your learning materials in Latex (a summarization would be optimal) annotate them with sections, subsections etc that would be answers to questions. Notate that questions with ```#Q: What does the fox say?``` in the corresponding block (highest gets choosen)
2. Copy & Paste (or pass via CLI, don't know, maybe both) the .tex to the application
3. See your questions in a list, possibly edit them
4. Click a test button, which takes a unasked (or worst rated) bulk of questions for you to answer
5. Click on a Question to see answer and rate how far you were away from this
6. Study faster and better
7. Win exam
8. ???
9. Profit
